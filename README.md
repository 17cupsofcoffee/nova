# Nova

Nova is a 2D game framework written in Rust.

This is a sort of spiritual successor to [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra), a game engine I worked
on between 2018 and 2022. It aims to be smaller and simpler than Tetra, with less global state.

#### ⚠️ Use at your own risk!

This framework is designed as a base for my own projects, rather than as a general-purpose library. Breaking changes will be frequent, and I will not give support or accept feature requests. That being said, feel free to use the code as a reference, or fork it for your own needs!
